    <h2>Target Audience</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Garfield.com targets families with younger children. The site provides humor and products for around 30-50ish adults but has playful designs and games that appeal to children around 4-10ish. It’s made to be simple so regardless of education one could enjoy most of it’s functions. The site is focused on Americans, being made in north america.
        </li>
        <li>The navigation bar and buttons were very self explanatory and easily seen on the screen. The ads don’t interfere with the content, staying off to the side.
        </li>
        <li>The alignment kept all the elements clearly visible with white space that kept the eye from being overly distracted. The buttons and options were large and easy to find.</li>
        <li>It was easy to find the primary function of reading comics, it was right in front. The navigation bar easily let me find related content such as games or merchandise I could purchase.</li>
        <li>The site helped mobile visitors keep up to date with the daily comics as well as previous ones since the comic section is on the front page as the first thing. It was a simple scroll to go down and find other related information, no scaling adjustments or side scrolling needed.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Persona</h2>

    <h2>Site Contrast</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="http://www.milehighcomics.com/"> milehighcomics.com</a></li>
        <li>Garfield kept the design simplistic and easy to navigate for younger audiences. High Comics didn’t seem to struggle with the target audience, it fell short on other things.
</li>
        <li>Garfield.com placed the most important features on the front page, letting navigations get you to more specifics. Mile High Comics threw everything at you at once so a first time viewer would struggle to determine where it all was on the page.</li>
        <li>Garfield.com had all the content vertically aligned to fit in the screen with a selective few navigation buttons. Mile High Comics used a horizontal layout with multiple search bars, columns of options, over all crowded content.</li>
        <li>Garfield just made it easy to read the comic that the audience is looking for, it was on the head page. Mile High Comics surrounded the visitor with a myriad of options that made it difficult to narrow down their purpose in being there.</li>
